# DataProductsWeek4

This repository contains the code and basic documentation for the Shiny App developed for the Developing Data Products course of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

We managed to make the app (hopefully) self-explanatory in that we offer two different way of adding markers to a world map
1. By entering latitude / longitude
2. By selecting from a predefined list of world capitals

After the values are entered or a world capital has been selected, hitting the respective button "Add Marker" or "Add Capital" will make the marker appear on the leaftlet map
